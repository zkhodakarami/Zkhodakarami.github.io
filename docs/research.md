### Quantifying Myelin Loss in Histology and Linking it to White Matter Hyperintensities in MRI
> Jun 2024 – Present

- Develop the first in vivo neuroimaging biomarker for diagnosis and targeted treatment of myelin loss.
- Register in vivo FLAIR, ex vivo T2 MRI, and histology images into the same space using greedy registration and rotation- and scaling-invariant template matching.
- Replicate neuro-pathologists' myelin loss rating with 90% accuracy.
- Assess white matter hyperintensities on matched in vivo and ex vivo brain MRIs; presented at AAIC 2025.

### Longitudinal Neuroimaging Abnormality Tracker [in development]
> Jan 2025 – Present

- Build a voxel-level MRI difference mask tool that enables clinicians to monitor abnormalities such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
- Generate reports with volumetric measurements by using image processing and LLM APIs.
- Complete primary market research for angel investors in “Disciplined Entrepreneurship” format.

### Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Subtype Discovery [under review]
> May 2025 – Jul 2025

- Lead data analysis in a 144-autopsy cohort; cluster neurofibrillary-tangle densities and measure cortex:hippocampus ratios to identify a novel “idiotypic-susceptible” subtype.
- Link findings to corticobasal syndrome and MAPT/APOE genotypes.
- Improve the accuracy of AD categorization by 20%.
